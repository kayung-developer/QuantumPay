## üöÄ Getting Started & Local Setup

(Instructions for local setup remain the same as the previous README)

## üåê Deployment to Vercel (Unified Monorepo)

This project is configured for a seamless single-project monorepo deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file in the root directory orchestrates the entire process.

1.  **Create ONE Vercel Project:** Link it to your Git repository.
2.  **Root Directory:** In the Vercel project settings, **leave the Root Directory as the default** (`.`). The `vercel.json` file will handle the monorepo logic.
3.  **Build & Development Settings:** Vercel should auto-detect the monorepo structure from `vercel.json`. If you need to set it manually:
    *   **Framework Preset:** "Other"
    *   **Build Command:** `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
    *   **Install Command (for backend):** `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Go to the "Environment Variables" section of your Vercel project.
    *   Copy **ALL** key-value pairs from your local `backend/.env` file.
    *   Copy **ALL** `REACT_APP_` key-value pairs from your local `frontend/.env` file.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Update the URLs to their production values as per the guide below.
5.  **Deploy!** Vercel will build both the Python backend and the React frontend and deploy them under a single domain.
